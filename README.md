### App Idea: **Campus Connect**

Campus Connect is an app for college students to stay connected with classmates, clubs, and campus events. I often use different apps to talk to friends, check events, or find help with classesâ€”this app brings all of that into one place.

**Main Features:**
- Student profiles with interests and classes  
- A feed for club events, workshops, and school news  
- Chat boards for each class or club  
- Sync class schedule and set reminders

Itâ€™s like a mix of Discord, LinkedIn, and Canvas made just for students on campus.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
As a beginner, I hit a roadblock on my very first projectâ€”I was stuck for over an hour trying to figure out why the Assistant feature wasnâ€™t working. For some mysterious reason, the ViewController file was read-only, and nothing I tried seemed to fix it. After testing every possible solution I could find, a simple Xcode restart ended up solving the issue. Lesson learned: sometimes, turning it off and on really does work!
